### Being open about being open

Recently [André Maia Chagas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amaiachagas), creator of [Openeuroscience](http://openeuroscience.com/) (which I love by the way) gave me an opportunity to write a short piece about a project I have been collaborating on for some time now: [OpenWorm](http://www.openworm.org/).

You can read the piece [right here](http://openeuroscience.com/software/open-worm/), and make sure you check out the rest of Openeuroscience while you're thinking about it; there are a surprising number of open source neuroscience products and projects, and André has done a good job of collecting them in one place.

Also take a look at the [OpenWorm project on GitHub](https://github.com/openworm/) if you are interested in contributing. I'll be writing about my experience with OpenWorm in some upcoming posts.
